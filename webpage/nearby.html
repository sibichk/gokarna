            <img src="images/Main_entry_to_the_Mahabaleshwar_Temple_at_Gokaran.jpg" width="200" height="100" alt="Gokarna Mahabaleshwara Temple" /><h2>
<p>The revered Atmalinga in the Mahabaleshwara temple is said to have been brought here by Ravana. It is said that Ravana did penance to obtain the Atmalinga, the possession of which would have made him invincible. Lord Shiva gave him the Atmalinga but told him that if he ever placed it on the ground before he got to Lanka; he would not be able to lift it again.</p>
<p>As the Devas did not want Ravana become even more powerful and extend his tyranny across more worlds, they prayed to Lord Ganesha who tricked Ravana into placing the Atmalinga down on the ground at Gokarna. As he was not able to lift it up again, Ravana had to leave without it. A temple was built to house this powerful Atmalinga - the Mahabaleshwara Temple. There are many other temples in Gokarna and surrounding areas like the Maha Ganapathy Temple, the Uma Maheshwari Temple, and the Bhadrakali Temple, Varadaraja Temple, Tamragauri Temple and the Venkataramana Temple.</p></h2>

<img src="images/Murudeshwara Karnataka Lord Shiva Statue.JPG" width="200" height="100" alt="Murdeswara"/><h2>
<p>Murudeshwar, the pilgrimage paradise and a scenic holy place, has recently shot into prominence as one of the loveliest spots in Karnataka. The tiny town of Murudeshwar, home to a huge Shiva temple, is also home to a sizable Muslim and Christian population. This is really a secular village and people of this small town live in harmony. The place is sanctified by a piece of the Pranalinga of Mahabaleshwara and has some beautiful carvings and statues. Bounded by the shimmering sea and rolling hills, the place is a favorite picnic spot. </p>

<p>One can enter Murudeshwar from the Bhatkal-Honnavar National Highway through a specially erected big entrance decorated with intricate carvings. Murudeshwar symbolises the past glory of Hinduism. It is centered on the splendid Murudeshwar temple atop a hillock overlooking the Arabian Sea. </p>

<p>Bounded by the shimmering sea and rolling hills, Murudeshwar is the sort of place which makes you contemplate about life and what it means to you. </p>

<p>The sea is an intrinsic part of the temple scape at Murudeshwar. The sea surrounds the temple towering on the small hill called Kanduka Giri on three sides. A huge 15 m statue of Shiva towers over the town and has an overwhelming presence. The statue, which is only a couple of years old, is in a complex, which encompasses the 500-year-old Shiva temple. </p>

<p>One is greeted with the bewitching beauty of the surroundings as one reaches the top of the hillock. The vast stretches of silvery sands with the Sahyadri mountains framed into the background, the coconut trees dancing to the tunes of the billows, rose of boats dancing and drifting towards the shore, the sun looking like a ball of fire just before the sunset and then sinking into the sea - all weave a magic spell and make the viewers forget themselves. </p>

<p>There is also a huge fort behind the temple believed to be renovated by Tipu Sultan, the ruler of Mysore.</p></h2>

<img src="images/IMG_1190.JPG" width="200" height="100" alt="Mirjan Fort" /><h2>
<p> The Mirjan Fort is located on the west coast of the Uttara Kannada district in the southern Indian state ofKarnataka. The fort known for its architectural elegance was the location of several battles in the past. It is about 0.5 kilometres (0.31 mi) from the National Highway 17 and 11 kilometres (6.8 mi) from Gokarna, the famous Hindu pilgrimage centre on the west coast of India.[1][2]</p>
<p>According to the first historical version, Queen Chennabhairadevi of Gersoppa (under the Vijayanagara Empire) was initially credited with building the Mirjan Fort in the 16th century. She ruled for 54 years and also lived in the fort.[3][4][5] During her reign, the port at Mirjan, which is 32 kilometres (20 mi) to the south east of Karwar, was used for shipping pepper, saltpetre and betel nut to Surat. Gersoppa, a district annexed to Bednur, was famous for the pepper exported from this region. Consequently, thePortuguese gave the epithet "Rani, the Pepper queen" to the Queen of Gersoppa.</p></h2>
<h3 class="blue"><b>Vibothi falls</b></h3>
<img src="images/cba8913f19feefc7586c432aa9024188_large.jpg" width="200" height="100" alt="Vibothi falls" /><h2>
<p>One of the numerous waterfalls of the Western Ghats. This beautiful waterfall is at few kilometers distance from the place Yana.</p>
 
<p>    Along with the two huge rocks there is one more limestone rock structure (which is quite small in size compared to the giants) in the vicinity. When asked a localite said the waterfall got the name as Vibhooti falls because of this Lime Stone rock nearby.</p>
 
<p>    Once the Vaddi ghats are over you can feel the humidity of the coastal Karnataka (Coast is few hours journey from here). One will have to take a deviation at a place called Mabagi. From here the water fall is around 3kms distance. Though one finds few houses nearby the tentage and food are the items one should pack.</p>
